DO:
Write the summary line and description of what you have done in the 
imperative mode, that is as if you were commanding someone. Start 
the line with "Fix", "Add", "Change" instead of "Fixed", "Added", 
"Changed".

Always leave the second line blank.

Line break the commit message (to make the commit message readable 
without having to scroll horizontally

"git add -p" (or -i) to split up changes into logical commits.
